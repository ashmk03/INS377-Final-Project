    <h2>Our Inspiration</h2> <br>
    <p>
      The idea for this project was born from a shared passion for aviation, creativity, and storytelling. We understand the importance of being ready for your flight and how difficult it can sometimes be to get access to up-to-date information.<br>
      Our main audience for this application are the general public, aviation, journalists, and first-time fliers as we aim to make navigating air travel more accessible and less stressful for everyone. <br>
      We believe that offering users clear, reliable, and real-time tools can help make the normal, chaotic travel experience go from overwhelming to effortless.
